### This is unfinished. Dont use it, about maybe 30% complete or less

I don't recommed using or finishing this inventory since the ui is kinda crap, It utilises my own framework so you'd have to convert it to your framework if you'd like to look at it

I made this to experiment and learn react-dnd, which was a good project for it. Were going to use it for Shattered RP but we decided not to develop a whole inventory cause of the bug testing and the time it would take to get a good working inventory. Uploading this for others to look through and maybe get inspiration or knowledge to make your own inventory. However If i were to be making this again, I would be using more hooks and make a provider for the inventory functions so the inventory store isn't filled with all functions.

UI

```
Bun run dev // start dev at http://localhost:5173/
Bun run build // Builds it
```
